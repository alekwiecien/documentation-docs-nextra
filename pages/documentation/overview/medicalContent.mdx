The medical knowledge base is one of the core components of every solution that's developed by Infermedica. It contains thousands of medical concepts - symptoms, conditions, risk factors - that help us describe and precisely identify the most probable issues facing children and adults.

#Content development process
The creation, validation and maintenance of the information in the medical knowledge base follows a rigorous and well-established procedure. The content development process is divided into stages, as outlined in the diagram below. These stages include:

defining the scope of the desired changes,
eliciting expert knowledge based on literature and other available sources,
specifying the test criteria,
performing manual and automated acceptance tests,
deploying the verified model to the API.
The process can be efficiently repeated with automated regression testing to ensure the system's stability.
